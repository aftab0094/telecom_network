When mary talks the voice is converted to electrical signal in her phone.

The phone converts the voice into electrical signal and sends it as electromagnetic wave. This signal travels through
the air to the nearest BTS[show a arrow from mary's phone to tower.

The nearest cell tower recieves the signal from Mary's phone. The strenth of the signal depends on the distance between
the phone and the tower. If the signal is weak, call quality reduces.[focus on tower]
))) part 4

The mobile network checks where Nanny is located and routes the call through the core network. The network selects
the best path to reach Nanny's nearest tower.[arrow going to the 2nd tower]

The signal is sent from Nanny's nearest tower to her mobile phone. Her phone converts the digital signal back into
sound allowing her to hear Mary's voice.[Mary and Nanny's phone will be in 'call accepted screen']

(((
Both of them now can talk and listen at the same time. The network continuously manages the signals to keep the calls
stable while they speak.
))) part 7

If a user goes too far from the tower , or if the network is congested, the signal becomes weak. This can cause noise,
delay, or call drop[Mary goes away form tower]
